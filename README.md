# Information
This is a students only project. It should be a simple, safe and anonymous chat system with a decentralised infrastructure.
It is split in to two parts. The backend is written in C and provides the websocket.
The other part is the frontend which is written in javascript.

# Usage
To use the chat system you simply go to "www.chatconnect.com" and you register your account. Therefor you need a username and a password.
To chat with another user you simply search for the other user and that's the start of your conversation.

# Theory behind the project
This is just a short description on how this chat system is working.
In the backend you have a routing which is not traceable, because we use different servers. Every message is encoded so
no other person could see the message.
